	Project Name : diff command	
	
	Objective :  
		syntax :diff [OPTION] FILES
		
		diff command can be used to compair two files line by line . In its output , it prints the lines from the files which are not 		same depending on the option we have given . Also we are going to impliment patch command which can be used to store the dissimiller 
	lines in two files into the third file which is called patch file and we can edit orignal file using patch file .
	
	I am going to impliment following options :
	-y  -c  -r  -t  -w  -b -i 
	for patching of files we have to impliment -u also .
	


		For this project I am going to use open and close functions to open the files . We have to use string librarys functions to 		compair two lines . use errno library to show errors.
